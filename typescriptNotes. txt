To download the typescript first we need to download node js in our PC and then go to the Typescript official website , read the docs and download the typescript or you can simply type
"npm i -g typescript" to install the typescript globally in your PC

LESSON-1
** INSTALL AND RUN TYPESCRIPT

Typescript is a static typed language which help us to catch the error while developing unlike javascript which catch the error in run time and its difficult to debug.

To run the typescript file we need to open the terminal and go to that file directory where we make our index.ts file and then simply type 'tsc filename' then it will compile our typescript file into javascript file it make the js file in the same directory.

LESSON 2
** TS CONFIGURATION FILE AND PROGRAM TO ADD TWO NUMBERS AND CATCH AND SOLVE THE ERROR IN TS
Type annotation is the way of declaring variable as a type(number,string and so on).
Typescript throws the error during the compilation time so we know the error while developing.
 //@ts-ignore is used to warning in the TS

 CONFIGURATION
 without TSconfig file ts compiler will create its js file so to get rid of this we use tsconfig file.

 To set the ts config file do the following steps.
tsc --init   It will create a ts config file
open tsconfig file click ctrl+f and type "noEmitOnError" and uncomment that code and you're ready to go. But keep that in mind that the index.ts file and the config file must be in a same directory. And run only "tsc" command no need to run "tsc index.ts".

LESSON_3
** TYPE ANNOTATION
Type annotation is the way of specifying the variable function parameter and function return value and it helps the TS compiler to enforce type checking and provide type safety during development, as well as what operations could be performed on that variable or value.
type annotation can be expressed by using the colon after the variable "egVariable:string"

List of types in ts are as follows: -

1. Unknown
2. Any
3. Undefined
4. Void
5. Null
6. Number , Number Enum
7. BigInt
8. Boolean
9. String , String Enum
10. Symbol , Unique Symbol
11. Object , Array , Tuple
12. Function
13. Constructor
14. Never

Learned about number type and string type in TS

Some of the practice question to do it on your own.

//Practice Set
// Declare a variable longText of type string and assign it to a long sentence. Extract the first 10 characters from longText and store them in a variable called shortText

// Declare two variable str1 and str2 of type string and assign them different sentences. Compare the two strings and store the results (true or false) in a variable called areEqual.

// Declare variables product and price of type string and number , respectively. Create string using template literals to display the product and price in the format "The product is ${product} is priced at ${price} dollars"
